Subject: AI-Powered Tool to Support 18B Panel Attorneys - Partnership Inquiry

Dear Director Leahy,

I am developing Assigned Co-Counsel, a free AI-powered practice management platform specifically designed for 18B panel attorneys. Our goal is to reduce administrative burden by 10+ hours per week, enabling attorneys to accept more cases while maintaining quality representation.

The NYC Bar Association's Interim Report on Assigned Counsel identified technology gaps as a key factor in the recruitment and retention crisis. Our platform addresses this directly with:

• AI-powered case analysis (multi-perspective: defense, prosecution, judicial)
• Citation-backed legal research using RAG technology
• Automated voucher preparation and compliance checking
• Criminal and family law workflow templates

We're seeking ILS support for a NYC pilot program serving 500 attorneys. The platform is already functional at https://assigned-co-counsel.web.app.

Would you or your team have 30 minutes to discuss how this tool could support ILS's mission?

Best regards,
[Name]

Subject: Legal AI for Indigent Defense - Google.org Partnership Inquiry

Dear Google.org Team,

Assigned Co-Counsel is a free AI platform serving 18B panel attorneys—the lawyers who represent people who cannot afford counsel in New York. We're leveraging Google technologies (Firebase, Gemini) to transform how legal aid is delivered.

The Problem:
• New York's assigned counsel system is in crisis
• Attorneys spend 30-40% of time on administrative tasks
• Technology could save 10+ hours/week per attorney

Our Solution:
• AI-powered case analysis using Gemini
• RAG-based legal research reducing hallucinations
• Secure document management via Firebase
• Completely FREE to ensure maximum access

We're seeking Google.org support:
• Google Cloud credits for scaling ($100,000)
• Gemini API access for legal research
• Potential Google.org grant for development

This aligns with Google's AI for Social Good initiatives and demonstrates responsible AI in a high-stakes domain.

Subject: Constitutional AI in Legal Practice - Research Partnership Proposal

Dear Anthropic Partnerships Team,

I'm building Assigned Co-Counsel, a free AI platform for public defenders and assigned counsel. We're interested in exploring how Constitutional AI principles can be applied to legal practice—a domain where accuracy, safety, and ethical considerations are paramount.

Why Legal AI Needs Constitutional AI:
• Legal advice directly impacts liberty and rights
• Hallucinations can cause real harm to clients
• Citation accuracy is critical
• Ethical boundaries (privilege, conflicts) must be respected

Our Proposal:
• Integrate Claude for legal research with constitutional safety constraints
• Document and share learnings on legal AI safety
• Provide attorney feedback on AI behavior in legal contexts

We believe legal practice is an ideal testing ground for Constitutional AI principles. Would Anthropic be interested in a research partnership?

Best regards,

Subject: Pro Bono Westlaw Access for New York's Assigned Counsel

Dear Thomson Reuters Legal Aid Team,

Assigned Co-Counsel is developing a free practice management platform for New York's 18B panel attorneys—lawyers who represent indigent defendants in criminal and family cases.

One barrier these attorneys face is access to comprehensive legal research. While free resources exist (CourtListener, Google Scholar), they cannot match Westlaw's comprehensiveness.

Partnership Proposal:
• Westlaw API integration for verified 18B panel members
• Pro bono access tier or heavily subsidized pricing
• Co-branded "Westlaw for Assigned Counsel" initiative

Benefits to Thomson Reuters:
• 10,000+ attorney exposure in NY alone
• Demonstrates commitment to access to justice
• Develops future Westlaw customers
• Positive PR in legal community

We're not asking for unrestricted access—just a pathway for verified assigned counsel to access research tools that enable quality representation.

Would your team be interested in exploring this partnership?

Best regards,
[Name]
